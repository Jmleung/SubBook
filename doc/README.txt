The intent of this project is to create an app that tracks monthly expenses in the following format: Name|Date|Cost|Comment.
There is additional functionality to add,remove and edit each of the individual line. But the current build of this app
has a major error, which has been narrowed down to a failed implementation the ArrayAdapter<Sub>, which leads to the program
not running. But the program does compile correctly without errors or warnings, and the activity files are also fully completed with
the intention to be run on a final working program if the ArrayAdapter could be implemented properly. This is also the reason why
there is no video associated with this project. All other key features are implemented and compile without error but are untested.
